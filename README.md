# Pulmonary-disease-detection-using-deep-learning


# Overview
With the advent of deep learning, there has been a growing interest in disease classification using medical imaging techniques. 
This project leverages deep learning architecture, specifically Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), to accurately identify different pulmonary diseases, 
such as pneumonia and COVID-19, from chest X-ray images of healthy individuals. The model's architecture includes convolutional layers, batch normalization, 
ReLU activation, max-pooling layers, fully connected layers, SoftMax activation, and classification layers.

# Dataset
The dataset used in this project comprises 3,000 images, encompassing a range of chest X-rays. These images cover healthy lung scans, scans of COVID-19 patients,
and scans of pneumonia patients. This diverse dataset plays a pivotal role in training and testing the deep learning model.

# Model Performance
The deep learning model achieves an accuracy of 85% in classifying pulmonary diseases based on chest X-ray images. This accuracy is promising and demonstrates the 
potential of deep learning techniques in medical imaging.

# Purpose
The primary purpose of this project is to assist healthcare professionals in the rapid and accurate identification of pulmonary diseases using chest X-rays. By automating 
the disease classification process, this work aims to:

Aid healthcare professionals in making faster and more informed decisions.
Improve the efficiency of disease diagnosis, especially in cases like pneumonia and COVID-19.
Enhance patient care and outcomes through early detection and treatment.
